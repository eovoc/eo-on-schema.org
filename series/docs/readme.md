# Use with W3C JSON-LD and RDF

The Web page https://schema.org/docs/howwework.html provides a https://schema.org/docs/jsonldcontext.json[JSON-LD context file] which is needed to use schema.org with W3C JSON-LD format.  Unfortunately, this file assumes that `http` is used instead of `https` for the schema.org namespace.  An updated version to be used in combination with the `https` namespace is provided in this folder.

The use of the `https://schema.org` namespace is recommended by https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/GETTING-STARTED.md[science-on-schema.org].
