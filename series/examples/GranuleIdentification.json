	"description": "Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper high-quality ortho-rectified L1T dataset acquired by ESA over the Fucino, Matera, Kiruna and MAspalomas visibility masks, as well as campaign data over Malindi, Bishkek, Chetumal, Libreville and O'Higgins. The acquired Landsat TM scene covers approximately 183 x 172.8 km. A standard full scene is nominally centred on the intersection between a path and row (the actual image centre can vary by up to 100m). A full image is composed of 6920 pixels x 5760 lines and each band requires 40 Mbytes of storage space (uncompressed).",
